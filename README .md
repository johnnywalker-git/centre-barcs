# Centre Barks

This was a landing page style site built for a client who walks dogs. The design is simple, and offers the user to see all about the business and services it offers, as well as being able to leave details to be contacted at a further date.

I intergrated google sheets in to the sign up form, to make it easy for the business owner to navigate new sign ups. Once signed up, it will automatically email the client with a friendly welcome message.




## The Design

I wanted the design to feel as open and outdoory-sy as possible so opted for a green colour-scheme. All containers within the layout are bespoke and feature some rather meticulous CSS handling.

It was also important for the business to have analytics for customer retention and engagement, so this was added using Google analytics. Also, it was built with mobile in mind, so is fully responsive for all screen sizes.
